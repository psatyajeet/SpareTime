<h1> SpareTime </h1>

<P> This application was built using the Django framework using the MVC (or Model-View-Template in Django) architecture. The entire applicationn is wrapped in a virtual environment (venv) so that the installed plug-ins are contained within the application. The requirements for this project can be found in requirements.txt and can be installed via pip. Django itself can also be installed with pip. 

<P>
Our entire codebase can be find within the mysite folder. We will go folder-by-folder and file by file to describe how the system is built.
