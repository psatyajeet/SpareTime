<P> Facebook has changed the medium through which we plan events, but not the process. Finding people's availability is still the bottleneck in the planning process. SpareTime is a replacement of whenisgood and Doodle, connecting to Facebook to find your friends and your Google calendar to get your most up-to-date calendar. From our application you can see when your friends, coworkers, or teammates are available in real time in order to plan your next event. You can do all of this without the hassle of waiting for them to fill out their availability by hand. 

<P> Anyone can access a fully-functional version of SpareTime at http://sparetime.herokuapp.com. From there, you can sign up with a Facebook account and start using our application.

<P> Who to contact in case something goes wrong.

<blockquote>
<P> <a href="a-link-to-your-project-web-page"> Your project's web page</a>
or home page or the like: the place to find all public information
about your project.
This may be the same link as the "how to access a running version"
page.


<P> <a href="timeline.html">Timeline</a>

<P> <a href="internals.html">Internals</a>

<P> <a href="report.html">Report</a>

<P> <a href="presentation.pdf">your presentation slides, etc., if you used them</a>.
Please submit these as PDF or as a web page, not Powerpoint.
</blockquote>

<P> These links must point to either HTML
or PDF files with names like internals.html or internals.pdf.
They must not require logging in to some place like Google Docs.
My goal is to have the submissions be uniform at this level
so the TAs and I can access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
